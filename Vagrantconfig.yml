# This is a simple configuration file sourced by the Vagrantfile
# You should delete values if you want to use the defaults (check the top of the Vagrantfile for the default values)
# If you only leave them empty, then an empty value is used!

# String interpolation with the configurated values is used on all commands configured.
# This means that you could for example write the following command:
#  'mysql -uroot -p%{mysql.rootpass} %{mysql.databases[0]} < /vagrant/database_dump.sql'
# This also means that you can define any custom configuration parameters in this configuration file and reference them inside the commands!
